1. What is required from ORM to make two tables with a bi-directional one-to-many relationship produce a joined column relation.
we need to say @onetomany in the parent entity above the attribute that links both and in the child you write @manytoone and give it a variable from the parent and you should be good to go.

2. Why is ORM worth implementing? List 2 reasons with a brief explanation.
● Business code access objects rather than DB tables.
● Hides details of SQL queries from OO logic.
● Based on JDBC 'under the hood.'
● No need to deal with the database implementation.
● Entities based on business concepts rather than database
structure.
